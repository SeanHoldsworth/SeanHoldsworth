I'm now in the process of uploading some of the hobby projects and course work I've been working on to GitHub for the amusement of others.
Currently there are examples of code written in Python, Java, Clojure and JavaScript.
I'm always interested in improving my code so would appreciate you letting me know if you spot any errors.

My current project is to get up to speed with full stack development using JavaScript, React and Node.js.
